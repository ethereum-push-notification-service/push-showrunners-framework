FUSION, developed in collaboration by THENA, Gamma Strategies, and Algebra, simplifies the management of Concentrated Liquidity (CL) while enhancing capital efficiency and user experience.</p>\\n<p>In this follow-up article, we explore the concept of concentrated liquidity, the roles of Gamma Strategies and Algebra in FUSION, and the benefits and potential drawbacks of this DeFi innovation.</p>\\n<p>If you haven’t read the previous article on FUSION, read it <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@ThenaFi/fusion-spark-a-new-era-in-defi-with-thenas-concentrated-liquidity-breakthrough-1f6d647dc60c\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>If you’d rather skip the details and go straight to the migration guide, simply scroll to the end of this article.</p>\\n<h3>Understanding Concentrated Liquidity</h3>\\n<p>Imagine a farmer watering their crops. Instead of using sprinklers that sprays water across the entire field, the farmer selectively waters the plants that need it the most.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vf3CRtTQWzLkB8Av\\\"></figure><p>Similarly, in DeFi, CL allows Liquidity Providers (LPs) to focus their funds within specific price ranges where they are most needed, rather than spreading them across the entire price spectrum. This targeted approach results in more efficient trades and higher fees for LPs while reducing slippage for traders.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/562/0*Nq_mtjBKEL0PVRAo\\\"><figcaption><em>Concentrated Liquidity concentrates liquidity into a tighter price range</em></figcaption></figure><h3>The Importance of Concentrated Liquidity</h3>\\n<p>CL offers several advantages over traditional liquidity models:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Capital efficiency: </strong>By focusing liquidity within specific price ranges, it can achieve up to 10x capital efficiency compared to traditional models. As a result, the protocol can rely on fewer incentives to attract LPs, freeing up resources to expand their offerings or generate more fees.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>More efficient trading: </strong>CL enables better price execution for traders and protocols, reducing slippage and promoting more efficient trades.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Enhanced flexibility:</strong> LPs have greater control over their risk exposure and returns by choosing the price range within which they want to provide liquidity.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>However, CL also has some drawbacks:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Complexity: </strong>Managing CL can be challenging, as it requires constant monitoring and adjustments to stay within the optimal price range.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Risk of impermanent loss: </strong>If asset prices move beyond the chosen range, LPs may face a higher risk of impermanent loss and miss out on fee generation, making CL less suitable for highly volatile assets.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Barriers to entry: </strong>Some CL solutions can be overwhelming for new users, as they require a deeper understanding of market dynamics and strategies to manage liquidity effectively.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Impermanent Loss and Concentrated Liquidity</h3>\\n<p>Returning to the farmer metaphor: The farmer waters crops that need water the most. Unpredictable factors, such as weather (price fluctuations), can result in some crops within the watered area growing slower, while those in other areas experience surprising growth. The farmer encounters an impermanent loss (IL) due to missing potential growth from the unwatered regions. This loss is temporary since, if conditions change and the watered crops catch up in growth, the loss vanishes, and the farmer still profits from the harvest (trading fees).</p>\\n<p>Enter Gamma Strategies, a highly intelligent swarm of drones that oversee the farm and closely monitors every plant to provide each one with the optimal amount of water without wasting any resources.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SHOcTf1baDC0e7cE\\\"></figure><p>Impermanent loss occurs in CL pools when asset prices shift significantly, causing LPs to have imbalanced token pairs. Gamma mitigates this issue by actively rebalancing the price ranges of LPs, maximizing fee generation and minimizing impermanent losses. See simple example how Gamma rebalances price ranges with market price volatility:</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MJFkHPbfRaOeZhpS\\\"></figure><p>That’s the essence of Gamma’s role in FUSION — automating the LP management process to simplify life for LPs while minimizing impermanent loss.</p>\\n<h3>Balancing Pros and Cons with FUSION</h3>\\n<p>At THENA, we recognize the importance of maximizing Concentrated Liquidity benefits while minimizing its drawbacks. FUSION tackles these challenges and makes CL more efficient and accessible for all users.</p>\\n<p><strong>1. Simplifying Complexity:</strong> FUSION incorporates Gamma’s automated strategies, which constantly manage and adjust positions to stay within the optimal range. This eliminates the need for active management by LPs, saving time and effort while reducing the risk of impermanent loss.</p>\\n<p>FUSION’s user-friendly platform makes concentrated liquidity accessible to a wider audience, including V2 farmers who might lack the expertise to effectively manage their strategies, catering to users of all experience levels.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. Reducing Impermanent Loss Risk:</strong> FUSION mitigates the risk of impermanent loss with built-in Gamma Strategies, which automatically adjust liquidity positions based on market conditions. This ensures users’ investments stay within the chosen range and continue to generate fees.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. Adapting to Market Volatility:</strong> FUSION, in collaboration with Algebra and Gamma Strategies, offers multiple strategies for managing liquidity, such as wide and narrow ranges for volatile assets and stable ranges for pegged assets. This flexibility allows users to choose the best strategy for their investments, regardless of market conditions.</p>\\n<p><strong>4. Dynamic Fee Optimization:</strong> FUSION incorporates Algebra’s dynamic fees that adapt to market conditions, optimizing revenue for LPs without requiring them to switch pools. This eliminates the need for multiple pools for each fee tier and maximizes revenue for the protocol by considering factors like volatility and trading volume. The fee structure increases in response to higher volatility and decreases to capture more trading volumes on DEX aggregators.</p>\\n<p>Manual market making can be challenging and less user-friendly. Although significant profits can be achieved with the right knowledge, our automated solution offers greater ease and profitability compared to competitors. Most users will likely benefit more from allowing Gamma to manage everything rather than attempting it themselves. In essence, we’ve simplified concentrated liquidity for you.</p>\\n<p>By addressing these challenges, FUSION makes concentrated liquidity more accessible and user-friendly, ultimately revolutionizing the DeFi ecosystem and creating a more efficient and profitable experience for both traders and liquidity providers.</p>\\n<h3>Six Pathways to Optimal Strategy</h3>\\n<p>FUSION presents a versatile range of LP strategies for both <em>volatile </em>and other assets. The platform features three primary strategies for <em>volatile </em>assets— narrow, wide, and manual modes — while offering pegged price, correlated, and stable strategies for other asset types. These diverse approaches enable beginner and experienced users alike to customize their investments based on personal preferences, risk tolerance, and the particular assets they are working with.</p>\\n<p>For a simpler launch, FUSION will initially not support distinct categories for Pegged Price and Correlated pools.</p>\\n<p>Refer to the summary table for a quick comparison below:</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9euoVR5tt02LxyEiOojtWA.png\\\"></figure><p>Let’s explore the narrow, wide and manual strategies in more detail — examining their benefits, trade-offs, and factors to consider when selecting the most suitable approach for your needs.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*VqRtXDSgh33eCIuV\\\"></figure><p><strong>1. Narrow Range: For assets with high price correlation and low price fluctuations</strong></p>\\n<p>The narrow range strategy focuses on a tighter price range between two assets.</p>\\n<p>This strategy works well for assets with high and positive price correlation as it concentrates the price range where most trading activity occurs. The Narrow Range also maximizes the fee-earning potential during periods of low market volatility. However, in the long term, higher fees may not compensate for the higher impermanent loss risk.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. Wide Range: For assets with low price correlation and high price fluctuations</strong></p>\\n<p>In contrast, the wide range strategy involves spreading liquidity over a broad price range between two assets.</p>\\n<p>This method is particularly effective for assets with low price correlation and significant price fluctuations. The strategy generates consistent fees during periods of market volatility, especially when high token volatility is anticipated, such as following a key release or unexpected news. Over the long run, the savings in impermanent loss will likely outweigh the higher fees in a narrow range.</p>\\n<p>For example, consider asset pairs like BNB-BTC or BTC-ETH. Although these pairs are volatile against USD, they display a strong positive price correlation. In such cases, the narrow range strategy might be more suitable due to the correlated nature of the assets.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. Manual Range (Custom Strategy): Geared towards experienced users seeking more control over their investments</strong></p>\\n<p>The manual range strategy allows LPs to set their preferred price range and adjust it based on market conditions. Note that opting for this approach means forgoing the automated Gamma system and associated staking rewards in THE tokens. Users will only earn trading fees from the pool while actively managing their positions to optimize returns. This strategy is best suited for skilled investors confident in their market navigation abilities.</p>\\n<p>By offering these distinct LP strategies, FUSION enables LPs to customize their investments according to their specific needs and preferences, providing a flexible and user-friendly platform for all.</p>\\n<h3>Pool Types and UI</h3>\\n<p>With THENA V2, the user interface is updated with changed pool categories. In THENA V1, there were stable and volatile pool categories.

FUSION, developed in collaboration by THENA, Gamma Strategies, and Algebra, simplifies the management of Concentrated Liquidity (CL) while enhancing capital efficiency and user experience.</p>\\n<p>In this follow-up article, we explore the concept of concentrated liquidity, the roles of Gamma Strategies and Algebra in FUSION, and the benefits and potential drawbacks of this DeFi innovation.</p>\\n<p>If you haven’t read the previous article on FUSION, read it <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@ThenaFi/fusion-spark-a-new-era-in-defi-with-thenas-concentrated-liquidity-breakthrough-1f6d647dc60c\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>If you’d rather skip the details and go straight to the migration guide, simply scroll to the end of this article.</p>\\n<h3>Understanding Concentrated Liquidity</h3>\\n<p>Imagine a farmer watering their crops. Instead of using sprinklers that sprays water across the entire field, the farmer selectively waters the plants that need it the most.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vf3CRtTQWzLkB8Av\\\"></figure><p>Similarly, in DeFi, CL allows Liquidity Providers (LPs) to focus their funds within specific price ranges where they are most needed, rather than spreading them across the entire price spectrum. This targeted approach results in more efficient trades and higher fees for LPs while reducing slippage for traders.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/562/0*Nq_mtjBKEL0PVRAo\\\"><figcaption><em>Concentrated Liquidity concentrates liquidity into a tighter price range</em></figcaption></figure><h3>The Importance of Concentrated Liquidity</h3>\\n<p>CL offers several advantages over traditional liquidity models:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Capital efficiency: </strong>By focusing liquidity within specific price ranges, it can achieve up to 10x capital efficiency compared to traditional models. As a result, the protocol can rely on fewer incentives to attract LPs, freeing up resources to expand their offerings or generate more fees.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>More efficient trading: </strong>CL enables better price execution for traders and protocols, reducing slippage and promoting more efficient trades.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Enhanced flexibility:</strong> LPs have greater control over their risk exposure and returns by choosing the price range within which they want to provide liquidity.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>However, CL also has some drawbacks:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Complexity: </strong>Managing CL can be challenging, as it requires constant monitoring and adjustments to stay within the optimal price range.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Risk of impermanent loss: </strong>If asset prices move beyond the chosen range, LPs may face a higher risk of impermanent loss and miss out on fee generation, making CL less suitable for highly volatile assets.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Barriers to entry: </strong>Some CL solutions can be overwhelming for new users, as they require a deeper understanding of market dynamics and strategies to manage liquidity effectively.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Impermanent Loss and Concentrated Liquidity</h3>\\n<p>Returning to the farmer metaphor: The farmer waters crops that need water the most. Unpredictable factors, such as weather (price fluctuations), can result in some crops within the watered area growing slower, while those in other areas experience surprising growth. The farmer encounters an impermanent loss (IL) due to missing potential growth from the unwatered regions. This loss is temporary since, if conditions change and the watered crops catch up in growth, the loss vanishes, and the farmer still profits from the harvest (trading fees).</p>\\n<p>Enter Gamma Strategies, a highly intelligent swarm of drones that oversee the farm and closely monitors every plant to provide each one with the optimal amount of water without wasting any resources.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SHOcTf1baDC0e7cE\\\"></figure><p>Impermanent loss occurs in CL pools when asset prices shift significantly, causing LPs to have imbalanced token pairs. Gamma mitigates this issue by actively rebalancing the price ranges of LPs, maximizing fee generation and minimizing impermanent losses. See simple example how Gamma rebalances price ranges with market price volatility:</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MJFkHPbfRaOeZhpS\\\"></figure><p>That’s the essence of Gamma’s role in FUSION — automating the LP management process to simplify life for LPs while minimizing impermanent loss.</p>\\n<h3>Balancing Pros and Cons with FUSION</h3>\\n<p>At THENA, we recognize the importance of maximizing Concentrated Liquidity benefits while minimizing its drawbacks. FUSION tackles these challenges and makes CL more efficient and accessible for all users.</p>\\n<p><strong>1. Simplifying Complexity:</strong> FUSION incorporates Gamma’s automated strategies, which constantly manage and adjust positions to stay within the optimal range. This eliminates the need for active management by LPs, saving time and effort while reducing the risk of impermanent loss.</p>\\n<p>FUSION’s user-friendly platform makes concentrated liquidity accessible to a wider audience, including V2 farmers who might lack the expertise to effectively manage their strategies, catering to users of all experience levels.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. Reducing Impermanent Loss Risk:</strong> FUSION mitigates the risk of impermanent loss with built-in Gamma Strategies, which automatically adjust liquidity positions based on market conditions. This ensures users’ investments stay within the chosen range and continue to generate fees.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. Adapting to Market Volatility:</strong> FUSION, in collaboration with Algebra and Gamma Strategies, offers multiple strategies for managing liquidity, such as wide and narrow ranges for volatile assets and stable ranges for pegged assets. This flexibility allows users to choose the best strategy for their investments, regardless of market conditions.</p>\\n<p><strong>4. Dynamic Fee Optimization:</strong> FUSION incorporates Algebra’s dynamic fees that adapt to market conditions, optimizing revenue for LPs without requiring them to switch pools. This eliminates the need for multiple pools for each fee tier and maximizes revenue for the protocol by considering factors like volatility and trading volume. The fee structure increases in response to higher volatility and decreases to capture more trading volumes on DEX aggregators.</p>\\n<p>Manual market making can be challenging and less user-friendly. Although significant profits can be achieved with the right knowledge, our automated solution offers greater ease and profitability compared to competitors. Most users will likely benefit more from allowing Gamma to manage everything rather than attempting it themselves. In essence, we’ve simplified concentrated liquidity for you.</p>\\n<p>By addressing these challenges, FUSION makes concentrated liquidity more accessible and user-friendly, ultimately revolutionizing the DeFi ecosystem and creating a more efficient and profitable experience for both traders and liquidity providers.</p>\\n<h3>Six Pathways to Optimal Strategy</h3>\\n<p>FUSION presents a versatile range of LP strategies for both <em>volatile </em>and other assets. The platform features three primary strategies for <em>volatile </em>assets— narrow, wide, and manual modes — while offering pegged price, correlated, and stable strategies for other asset types. These diverse approaches enable beginner and experienced users alike to customize their investments based on personal preferences, risk tolerance, and the particular assets they are working with.</p>\\n<p>For a simpler launch, FUSION will initially not support distinct categories for Pegged Price and Correlated pools.</p>\\n<p>Refer to the summary table for a quick comparison below:</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9euoVR5tt02LxyEiOojtWA.png\\\"></figure><p>Let’s explore the narrow, wide and manual strategies in more detail — examining their benefits, trade-offs, and factors to consider when selecting the most suitable approach for your needs.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*VqRtXDSgh33eCIuV\\\"></figure><p><strong>1. Narrow Range: For assets with high price correlation and low price fluctuations</strong></p>\\n<p>The narrow range strategy focuses on a tighter price range between two assets.</p>\\n<p>This strategy works well for assets with high and positive price correlation as it concentrates the price range where most trading activity occurs. The Narrow Range also maximizes the fee-earning potential during periods of low market volatility. However, in the long term, higher fees may not compensate for the higher impermanent loss risk.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. Wide Range: For assets with low price correlation and high price fluctuations</strong></p>\\n<p>In contrast, the wide range strategy involves spreading liquidity over a broad price range between two assets.</p>\\n<p>This method is particularly effective for assets with low price correlation and significant price fluctuations. The strategy generates consistent fees during periods of market volatility, especially when high token volatility is anticipated, such as following a key release or unexpected news. Over the long run, the savings in impermanent loss will likely outweigh the higher fees in a narrow range.</p>\\n<p>For example, consider asset pairs like BNB-BTC or BTC-ETH. Although these pairs are volatile against USD, they display a strong positive price correlation. In such cases, the narrow range strategy might be more suitable due to the correlated nature of the assets.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. Manual Range (Custom Strategy): Geared towards experienced users seeking more control over their investments</strong></p>\\n<p>The manual range strategy allows LPs to set their preferred price range and adjust it based on market conditions. Note that opting for this approach means forgoing the automated Gamma system and associated staking rewards in THE tokens. Users will only earn trading fees from the pool while actively managing their positions to optimize returns. This strategy is best suited for skilled investors confident in their market navigation abilities.</p>\\n<p>By offering these distinct LP strategies, FUSION enables LPs to customize their investments according to their specific needs and preferences, providing a flexible and user-friendly platform for all.</p>\\n<h3>Pool Types and UI</h3>\\n<p>With THENA V2, the user interface is updated with changed pool categories.
