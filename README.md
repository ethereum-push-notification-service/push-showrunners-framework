# PUSH Showrunners (Server)

The PUSH Showrunners handles the channels created and maintaned by us. It also shows how easy it is to interact with the protocol to build highly customized notifications for your dApp, smart contracts or even centralized services.

- Clone the repo
``` 
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-staging-v2.git

## Technical Details

Following definitions are used in the rest of the spec to refer to a particular category or service.
| Term | Description
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Showrunners | Showrunners are Channels on PUSH protocol notification protocol that are created and maintained by us |

### Tech Specs

The Showrunners run on node.js server and are modularized on the ideas and architecture of [Bulletproof NodeJS](https://github.com/santiq/bulletproof-nodejs), the essential features in the architeture are as follows:

- **config** defines all the necessary configuration
- **Jobs** is used to handle waking up different channels for various purpose. Very useful in sending notifications from channel at a specific interval
- **dbListener** can be used to listen to and trigger functions on DB changes, we have left the interpretation and an example over there for whoever wants to use them
- **showrunners** are the actual channels and contain logic which is required for them to construct notification according to their use cases
- **middlewares and routes** will probably not be active on your production server but are given to test the channel in development mode. for example: triggering functions using postman or similar service and seeing the response
- **database** the architecture has been changed from MongoDB to mysql to show how easy it is to have either of the database if required

### Credits

### External Services

We would need external services of:

- [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Primary Database : [Installation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) We would be using Mongodb Atlas
- [Redis](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Internal Cache : [Installation](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart)
- [Mongodb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

For local ease of development, we make use of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
